# RE-BOOK (Back-end)

This is the repository for Re-Book back-end files.

Re-Book is a web-app project of mine which lets users buy and sell books from a location. The idea is to build an app from where a person can search for cities and towns and look for people who are selling their books by creating a store on the platform.

## Features

* Create your profile and set up your store to list, delist or update books for sale. 
* Search for a location, store or genre and get stores in that location, or relevant to the genres and filter the stores by genre.
* Order from any store through a payment flow and track your order status.
* Change order status of orders for your own store.
